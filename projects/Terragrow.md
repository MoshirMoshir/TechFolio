**Code and Art by:** Moshir

In a whirlwind 18-hour sprint across 3 days, armed with nothing but passion and determination, we created this Unity-based game from scratch using C#. While the game might not boast the most intuitive design, the experience was nothing short of amazing and marked the inaugural step in my game development journey.

**Game Jam Challenge: "You Are the World"**

The project was born out of a game jam, a thrilling event where developers are tasked with creating a game in a limited timeframe. The challenge? Design a game around the theme unveiled at the start, in this case, "You Are the World." With only 3 days to conceive and craft, the pressure was on to infuse creativity and innovation into every line of code and pixel of art.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Independent Endeavor:** Crafted entirely by us, the project showcases both coding prowess and artistic flair in a testament to our commitment to learning and pushing boundaries.

- **Swift Creation:** Despite the tight deadline of a game jam, the game emerged as a testament to our dedication, squeezing creativity and functionality into every hour of development.

**Your Feedback Matters:**

I invite you to delve into the game, explore its nuances, and share your thoughts. Whether you uncover elements done exceptionally well or aspects that could be improved, your feedback is invaluable. This project is not just a game; it's the first step in my quest to master game development.

**Enjoy the Experience:**

While not flawless, we hope you find moments of joy in our creation. Have fun exploring, and thank you for joining us on this exhilarating game development adventure!
