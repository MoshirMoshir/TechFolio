### **Early Exploration**
My introduction to Javascript at the age of 10 on Khan Academy ignited a curiosity that led me to create simple programs, laying the foundation for my interest in Computer Science. Although I didn't delve into building fully functional applications, my early exposure set the stage for my coding journey.

### **Rediscovering Javascript in ICS 314**
In the present, I find myself in ICS 314, a software engineering course, reigniting my relationship with Javascript after a decade. Initially intimidated by over 100 coding problems assigned over the weekend, my fear diminished as I rediscovered the language's convenience. Unlike other languages, Javascript prioritizes user-friendly syntax, exemplified by its evolutionary updates like ES6, which enhance convenience and address previous issues. It's akin to an 'abc' coding language, versatile enough to build anything imaginable.

### **The WOD Experience**
The WODs (Workouts of the Day), inspired by the intensity of a Crossfit workout, prove invaluable for hands-on learning. As someone who learns best by putting theory into practice, the WODs offer a simulated real-world environment. With internet access but constrained by time, it mirrors situations demanding quick thinking and prioritization—an invaluable skill in the professional realm. Anticipation grows before each weekly WOD, with relief and satsifaction upon their completion, marking a semester filled with these immersive coding challenges.

### **Javascript's User-Friendly Edge**
Javascript emerges as an excellent language, particularly within the course context and WODs. Its user-friendliness allows for quick mastery, enabling us to focus on the essential thought processes in coding. JSFiddle, our chosen interactive coding environment for the WODs, adds another layer of immediacy by providing instant feedback and visible results. This combination facilitates a seamless learning experience, allowing quick iterations and enhancing our ability to gauge code functionality rapidly. I am excited about delving deeper into Javascript, exploring its nuances, and envisioning its role in shaping our professional portfolios.


*Here's to the coding journey—past, present, and the promising future with Javascript.*
