## Procrastination App
### The Problem: 
People, especially students, love to procrastinate. Whether it is related to work assignments, passion projects, chores, eating, and of course homework.

### The Solution:
With this new app, Students will be able to sign up, publish what they are procrastinating on, and link up with other students or are procrastinating on similar things if not the same assignments! They can then work together to help each other accomplish their goals. 

### Mockup Page Ideas
- Home Page (display top rated procrastinated goals)
- Profile Page (see your own or other procrastinated goals)
- Search Page (Search for keywords in other posts, with filters/tags)

### Use Case Ideas:
- User logs in and sees the top posts on the home page
- User goes to their profile to update their posts
- User browses other posts or profiles

### Beyond the basics:
 - Push similar goals to users with similar tags in their own posts on the home page instead of just top rated
- Have a reminder system that can send periodic emails to the user for each of their posts until they complete their goals (mark complete or delete, toggleable)
- Users can create groups and add each other to discuss similar goals or meet up to do them
