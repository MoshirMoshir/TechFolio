## What is it?
In my previous approach to programming, I didn't actively consider the role of software engineering in my work. I simply engaged in coding whenever the need arose to achieve specific goals. It wasn't until I posed the question, "What is it?" that I began to recognize the pervasive influence of software engineering at virtually every step of the development process.

## How did I use it?
Upon delving into the question, I came to the realization that software engineering isn't an abstract concept but rather the practical act of creating software. Reflecting on my experience, I acknowledged that I had been involved in software engineering both as a student and in my personal projects, often without explicitly acknowledging it. The realization shed light on the significance of structured and systematic approaches to software development.

## Future Endevours
Looking ahead, my aspirations involve delving deeper into the technical aspects of software engineering. I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concepts and methodologies. Moreover, I aspire to apply this newfound knowledge to revisit and enhance my previous projects. The goal is to modernize them by adhering to proper coding standards, ensuring longevity and sustainability in their functionality.

## And so...
The journey of exploring the essence of software engineering has not only unveiled its omnipresence in my past endeavors but has also sparked a desire to deepen my knowledge and apply it to future projects. The quest for technical proficiency and the commitment to modernizing existing work encapsulate my evolving relationship with the field of software engineering.
